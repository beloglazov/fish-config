# fish-config

This is my configuration of the awesome [fish
shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell). It's also using the
[oh-my-fish configuration framework](https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish). To
enable some of the nice functionality, you need to have
[fasd](ihttps://github.com/clvv/fasd) and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
installed. Too see what's available, please have a look at the included
functions and config.fish.

To install the configuration, just run the `install.sh` script.
